coding exercise - bowling score calculator

Problem Description
Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of throws for one game of American Ten-Pin
Bowling, produces the total score for the game . Your code will become the core of a bowling score
management system, so make sure it fully complies with the input and output requirements, and
represents your best code.
Remember: We’re evaluating your design and development skills based on the code you give
us. Make sure it reflects the type of code you’d write on a production software system for us.
Take your time. Remember to refactor and write unit tests.

*Bonus points for deploying in a Docker container.
